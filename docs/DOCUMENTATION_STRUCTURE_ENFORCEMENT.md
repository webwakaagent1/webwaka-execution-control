# MANDATORY: Documentation Structure Enforcement

**This is a mandatory directive for all agents (Coordinator, Implementer, Verifier). Failure to comply is a STOP condition.**

---

## 1. The Rule: Use the Centralized Structure

All documentation created or updated during this project **MUST** adhere to the centralized documentation structure. This is not a suggestion; it is a hard requirement.

**You are required to place all new documents in their correct locations and update the corresponding master index file.**

## 2. The Structure

| Resource Category | Directory Location | Master Index File (to be updated) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 📜 **Execution Prompts** | `/docs` | `docs/PHASE_1_PROMPT_LINKS.md` |
| 🤝 **Handover Packages** | `/handover` | `handover/HANDOVER_INDEX.md` |
| ✅ **Completion Reports** | `/reports/completion` | `reports/COMPLETION_REPORT_INDEX.md` |
| 🧪 **Test Reports** | `/reports/testing` | `reports/TEST_REPORT_INDEX.md` |

## 3. Your Responsibility

- **Before creating a new document:** Check the table above to identify the correct directory.
- **After creating a new document:**
    1. Place the file in the correct directory.
    2. **Open the corresponding Master Index file** and add a new row with the link to your new document.
- **When referencing any document:** Always link to the master index first, not the individual file. For example, refer to the "Completion Report Index" instead of a specific report file.

## 4. Why This is Mandatory

This system ensures a **single source of truth** and prevents documentation chaos. It allows any agent or human to find any document at any time without ambiguity.

**Compliance with this directive will be verified as part of every task completion.**
